  Included Assets
----------------------------

- Example Scenes (Assets\I2 Sci-Fi Indoor Facility\Scenes)

This Asset Pack was designed to be highly modular. 
It includes three example scenes showing how the sections can be combined to
create indoor environments.

- Rooms and Halls (Assets\I2 Sci-Fi Indoor Facility\Prefabs\Rooms)

This folder contains prefabs with different rooms layouts. Room can be dragged 
and they align exactly with each others. 
There are full rooms, and sections (corners, walls, etc)

Rooms are not a full mesh, instead they are build by combining smaller pieces. That way you can
expand the rooms, and adjust them to match the visual of your game.

- Individual Pieces (\Prefabs\Walls\ [Columns | Corners | Doors | Floor_Roof | Misc | Walls] )

This folder contains all the pieces used to build the rooms. 
Columns, walls, floor, etc. You will find all assets already classified on individual folders.



***** THIS ASSET DOESNT INCLUDE ANY IMAGE-EFFECT (BLOOM, HDR, etc) *******

Most images effects are Pro only, so the example camera is the default unity First Person Controller.
For better graphics and remove the Aliasing issues, please, setup the Image Effects to match your game. 

The Web Demo provided with this Assets uses FXPro to show how the assets look when applying Bloom and DoF.


----------------------------
  Using Marmoset Skyshop
----------------------------

This package is set by default to use the Unity standard materials. 
However, it also has materials compatibles with Marmoset Skyshop.
If you have that plugin in your project, please, unzip the 

Assets/I2 Sci-Fi Indoor Facility Marmoset.zip/I2 Sci-Fi Indoor Facility Marmoset.zip

That will replace the standard materials by the Marmoset ones and add reflection probes.


----------------------------
  Performance
----------------------------

All the assets are using only 12 Materials and 4 Textures, which makes Static Batching combine a lot of the objects and reduce drawcalls.
